Comprehensive documentation: API reference, developer guides, and user guides.

## Goals

- Plugin API reference (manifest spec, SDK types, lifecycle)
- Developer workflow guide (create, test, publish plugins)
- Permissions guide (domains, intervals, secrets)
- User setup guide (Pi installation, configuration)

## Scope

**In Scope:** API reference, dev guide, permissions guide, setup guide
**Out of Scope:** Video tutorials, hosted docs site (start with markdown in repo)

## Summary of Changes

All documentation tasks completed:

- lensing-ouge: Created docs/PLUGIN_DEVELOPMENT.md (developer workflow guide)
- lensing-mh4w: Created docs/PLUGIN_API_REFERENCE.md (API reference)

Both documents cover the full plugin system: manifests, lifecycle, data bus, permissions, testing, and publishing.
