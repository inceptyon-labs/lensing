Redesign admin/settings page to show only integration-category fields per module. API keys, server URLs, credentials — set up once centrally.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Settings page shows integration fields grouped by module
- [ ] Only modules that HAVE integration fields are shown
- [ ] Save triggers module restart if integration was updated
- [ ] Password fields redacted as before
